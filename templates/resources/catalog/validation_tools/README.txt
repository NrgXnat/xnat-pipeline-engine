CHANGELOG:

January 11, 2017

Validation schematron file can now use custom java functions to be used with input parameters specified using the site_imports.xsl file. 
If a project needs to overwrite these values or add additional parameters, one can have a project specific site_imports.xsl file. 



Validation plugin for XNAT

Implementation:

A Schematron based validation engine. Create a validation rule file and associate this file to a project and datatype. A datatype could have multiple rule files. Use the content tag  to differentiate between them. Admins while setting up the pipeline can choose the content tag.

For each datatype, say xnat:mrSessionData, create a collection with the content tag set to validation_xnat_mrSessionData (Note: Colon character in the datatype has been replaced by _)
 and insert files into this collection with different content tags using the following commands:
 
 XNATRestClient -host HOST -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -m PUT -remote "/REST/projects/YOUR_PROJECT/resources/validation_xnat_mrSessionData"
 
 XNATRestClient -host HOST -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -m PUT -remote "/REST/projects/YOUR_PROJECT/resources/validation_xnat_mrSessionData/files?content=DEFAULT" -local ./mrsession_rules.sch
